Thanks for this, the differences between the data and the paper had me very confused. I've now realised that I had been reading the data wrong; the means file starts:

1       h         30     0.1097     0.1526     0.0279
1       l         30    -0.3757     0.4185     0.0764
1       m         30    -0.1309     0.2820     0.0515
10      h         30     0.0474     0.1294     0.0236
10      l         30    -0.0461     0.1777     0.0324
10      m         30    -0.0039     0.1403     0.0256

i.e. the item indexes are in alphabetic rather than numerical order. I had assumed that the 2nd set of scores in the .means file (indexed as '10') were for the 10th set of items in the .items file, but if I assume the set-ordering in .means and .items is the same, the correlation scores make a lot more sense. I did mention my assumption in a previous email, but I probably didn't make it obvious enough that I was doing the wrong thing!

Thanks again for spending the time to help me out, it's really appreciated.
